TODO for Autonav:

update controller to use rosparam for frame name
update map_manager to use rosparam for frame name
update obstacle to use rosparam for frame name
update traj_generator to use rosparam for frame name

controller should load initial position from scenario params

split controller into vehicle model/visualization and controller

obstacle node should examine multiple paths per dynamic vehicle

obstacle node not drawing moving obstacles correctly... or advancing them at the right speed...

Is the vehicle model advancing the ego vehicle at the correct speed?
